# Prestigious Entities

This repository contains the code I wrote for my bachelor thesis. The Python script: mentionfeatureclassifier.py is heavily based on the mention feature classifier from the dutchcoref system. The code for this project can be found here: https://github.com/andreasvc/dutchcoref

We simply adjusted the mention feature classifier to also predict entity-categories. It is still possible to run the program in the same way as before. For detailed instructions on how to do this, refer to the dutchcoref GitHub page.

The code in this repository can be modified to parse all kinds of data, do keep in mind that some processing beforehand is needed. Again, instructions for this can be found on the dutchcoref GitHub page.
